# edX Bootcamp - Module 3 Challenge

## Description

I was tasked to use my newfound Bootstrap skills to recreate/improve my portfolio page, which I can add to as the edX Skills Bootcamp course progresses.

A special challenge was to use a minimum amount of CSS media queries, and instead take advantage of Bootstrap's Grid system. 

Note: I am currently on the Front End Web Developer course.
